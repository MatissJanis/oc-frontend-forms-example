This plugin demonstrates how to easily use the same backend forms in frontend controllers.

An example use case: client wants to build a guestbook that he can manage and in which the site's users can write in to. Esentially we need 2 forms for this: one in the backend (for the client) and one in the frontend (for the users). By using this method we can create just the backend form and use it in the frontend as well.

No more duplicate code, hardocded validations and whatnot else!

Enjoy,
